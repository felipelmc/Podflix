First of all, you need to upload the database file into the project (it's not in GitHub because of the size).

You must download the file [in this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8IAfZoq8wYoPlrfFHaVlnCo6iMSX0ff/view?usp=drive_link) and then move it to the `app` folder.

Finally, to run this project, you need to navigate to `app` folder and run
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Obs:
- You need to have docker installed on your computer.
